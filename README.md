# Habotica
[Habotica](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dexx.habotica&hl=nl) is an Android app, built in React Native, that automates some of the more tedious tasks involved in maintaining a [Habitica](habitica.com) account. 

## Getting started
Habotica is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Scaffolding is done by [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/facebook/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). 

Once you have all of those installed, running 
`yarn`
will install dependencies and
`expo start`
will start the application. 

We recommend installing an [Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) for speedy development, though the app can also be loaded on your phone if you want to hit the ground running. Instructions for opening the app on various platforms can be found in the Expo documentation. 

Currently, Habotica does not support multiple environments. As such, testing the app will require a valid Habitica account. 

## Disclaimer
This read me is shorter than it might be, mostly because I don't actually expect people to contribute, but also because I'm not really sure what kind of trouble people are going to run into. That brevity does not, in any way, reflect any lack in respect or heartfelt love for anyone who wants to help out, merely my low expectations and pragmatism. So if you want to get started and get stuck using the instructions above, please don't hesitate to drop me a line: I'm more than happy to help out.
